# CohortHive

## Project Summary

**Purpose:**
CohortHive is designed to tackle the challenges remote teams face in real-time collaboration. In an era where remote work is prevalent, the need for a seamless, integrated platform that enhances productivity and team coordination is critical. CohortHive aims to provide this by consolidating various collaborative tools into a single, user-friendly interface.

**Functionality:**
CohortHive enables users to create or join private rooms where team members can collaborate on projects in real time. Once logged in, users can view a list of rooms they are part of, create new rooms, or join existing ones. Room owners can add members, fostering a collaborative environment tailored to specific projects.

**Features:**

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Secure login process to ensure only authorized users access the platform.

2. **Room Management:**
   - Users can create or join private rooms.
   - Each room displays a list of members and allows room owners to manage member permissions.

3. **Announcements:**
   - Post and view important updates and announcements within the room to keep all members informed.

4. **Task Management:**
   - Add and manage tasks with timelines and deadlines, ensuring the team stays on track with project goals.

5. **Chat Portal:**
   - **Personal Chats:** Members can chat privately with each other.
   - **General Chats:** A room-wide chat feature for general discussions.

6. **Video Conferencing:**
   - Each room has a dedicated meeting portal.
   - Members can join ongoing meetings at any time without needing to create new links, simplifying the process of holding regular meetings.

7. **GitHub Integration:**
   - Users log in through GitHub OAuth to link their repositories.
   - Fetch and display repository details, including contributors, commit history, and branches.
   - View and edit repository content directly from the platform, facilitating seamless code collaboration.

8. **Work Collaboration:**
   - Add links to Google Docs, Slides, and Sheets.
   - Collaborate on these documents in real time from within the platform.

9. **Data Storage:**
   - All project details, task timelines, chat histories, and GitHub repository information are stored in a secure database.
   - Ensures that all relevant information is available and easily accessible, minimizing hassle and improving user experience.

**Unique Aspects:**
CohortHive stands out by integrating essential collaborative tools—chat, video conferencing, task management, and version control—into a single platform. The unique GitHub integration allows coders to collaborate on code directly from the platform, while the seamless integration with Google Workspace tools ensures all types of project documents are easily accessible and editable. This all-in-one approach significantly enhances the efficiency and productivity of remote teams.
